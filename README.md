# FACIAL-AUTHENTICATION
This repository contains a Python-based web application that demonstrates face authentication using Flask and OpenCV. The application allows users to authenticate themselves by capturing their face through a webcam, saving the face image, and later recognizing the face during the authentication process.

Files:
app.py: This file contains the main code for the web application, including the Flask routes and the face authentication logic.
templates/: This directory contains the HTML templates used for rendering different pages of the web application.
index.html: The home page where users can initiate the face authentication process.
welcome.html: The welcome page displayed when a user successfully authenticates.
Setup:

Install the required dependencies:

Flask (web framework)
OpenCV (computer vision library)
NumPy (numerical computing library)
Haar Cascades (pre-trained face detection model)
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

Replace 'your_secret_key' in app.py with a strong and random secret key for secure session management.

Run the Flask application using python app.py. The application will run on http://localhost:5000.

Webcam Face Capture:

The web application uses the / route (index) to display the home page index.html, where users are prompted to enter their name and email address. Upon submission of the form, the /authenticate route is triggered, capturing the user's face through the webcam and saving it in the faces/ directory using OpenCV. The Haar Cascades are utilized for face detection.

Face Authentication:

After capturing the user's face, the application initiates the face recognition process through the /authenticate route. The saved face image is loaded, and the webcam is again activated for face recognition. Template matching is performed using OpenCV to compare the captured face with the saved face image. If the similarity between the faces is above a predefined threshold, the user is authenticated, and their name and email are stored in the session.

Session Management:

The application uses Flask's session to store user information and authentication status between requests. Upon successful authentication, users are redirected to the /welcome route, which renders the welcome.html template, displaying a personalized welcome message with the user's name and email.

Important Note:

This implementation uses a basic face recognition technique for demonstration purposes. In real-world scenarios, more sophisticated face recognition models should be employed for higher accuracy and security.

The Haar Cascades used for face detection are relatively simple and might not be the most accurate face detection method available. Consider using more advanced face detection models if accuracy is critical.

Ensure compliance with all legal and ethical considerations when using face recognition or any biometric authentication method, including obtaining proper user consent and safeguarding user data.

Disclaimer:

This repository is intended for educational and demonstration purposes. Face recognition can be a useful authentication method, but it is essential to implement robust security measures and prioritize user privacy when dealing with biometric data.
